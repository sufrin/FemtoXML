<h1>
FemtoXML -- XML analysis infrastructure ($Revision:$)
</h1>
   <h2>
   Purpose
   </h2>
   <p>
      FemtoXML is an ultralightweight framework for analysing XML texts.
      It was designed to circumvent some of the awkwardness I found
      when using the SAX and SAX2 APIs.
   </p>
   <p>
      Lightness is achieved at the following cost:
      <ul>
      <li> The internal structure of 
           XML syntactic features that do not appear in
           all XML documents (Processing instructions and
           document type declarations) is
           ignored, and their text passed to handlers
           unscrutinised.
           </li>
      <li> An XML declaration: 
           <code>&lt;?xml ... version="..." charset="..."?&gt;</code> 
           is treated in
           the same way as any other processing instruction.
      </li>
      </ul>
   </p>
   <p>
        This cost is reasonable: anybody who wants to further analyse
        processing instructions and DOCTYPE declarations can easily 
        write specialised processors. An example application (a
        prettyprinter/recoder) demonstrates how straightforward
        DOCTYPE declarations can be processed in order to
        record their entity declarations.
   </p>
   <p>
        The information given in syntax-error messages is fairly good: the input
        file and line on which the error was discovered are given, together
        with the names of any entities that are currently being expanded.
   </p>
   <p>
        Character-entity expansion is table-driven, and therefore flexible. 
        The basic named entities are built-in, and other named character entities 
        can be added to the tables.
   </p>
   <p>
        XML analysis can be performed with or without entity expansion, thus
        it is fairly easy to build an XML ''prettifier''. 
        In fact the main
        example application we provide is a prettifier that constructs a
        complete ''parse tree'' before outputting it.
